2. **Developer Experience**: Improve development tooling and documentation
3. **Performance Optimization**: Implement identified performance improvements
4. **Community Contribution**: Prepare contribution guidelines and documentation

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Theme System**: Should maintain dynamic loading but consider build-time optimization for performance
2. **Configuration Management**: Current multi-source approach is powerful but complex - consider simplification
3. **Component Organization**: Feature-based organization is good but may need better abstraction layers

### Technical Debt Considerations
1. **Configuration Complexity**: The extensive configuration system may be overwhelming for new users
2. **Component Coupling**: Some components may have tight coupling that affects maintainability
3. **Plugin Dependencies**: Need to assess plugin update cycles and compatibility

### Performance Considerations
1. **Bundle Size**: Monitor and optimize JavaScript bundle sizes across themes
2. **Image Optimization**: Ensure all images are properly optimized for different devices
3. **Caching Strategy**: Review caching layers for optimal performance
4. **Build Times**: Monitor build performance as content volume grows

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Coding Patterns Observed
1. **Configuration-First**: Almost every feature is configurable rather than hard-coded
2. **Plugin-Based Architecture**: Features are implemented as plugins for modularity
3. **Theme Abstraction**: Business logic separated from presentation logic
4. **Error Boundary Usage**: Comprehensive error handling throughout the application

### Development Preferences
1. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Strong typing preferences for code quality
2. **ESLint + Prettier**: Automated code quality and formatting
3. **Feature-Based Organization**: Components organized by feature rather than type
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Jest-based testing strategy with good coverage

### User Experience Patterns
1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
2. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
3. **Accessibility Focus**: ARIA labels and semantic HTML usage
4. **Performance First**: Optimized for Core Web Vitals metrics

## Learnings & Project Insights

### Architecture Learnings
1. **Configuration Complexity Trade-off**: The sophisticated configuration system provides immense flexibility but increases complexity for new users
2. **Theme System Benefits**: Dynamic theme loading enables easy customization but requires consistent theme structure
3. **Plugin Ecosystem Value**: The plugin architecture allows for rich features without bloating core functionality

### Technical Insights
1. **Notion API Constraints**: Building around Notion API limitations requires careful rate limiting and error handling
2. **Static Generation Benefits**: SSG + ISR approach provides excellent performance for content-heavy sites
3. **Multi-language Implementation**: Sophisticated i18n approach supporting multiple Notion databases per language

### Development Insights
1. **Comprehensive Tooling**: Extensive use of development tools indicates focus on code quality and developer experience
2. **Documentation Quality**: Multiple documentation formats (README, DEPLOYMENT.md, etc.) show attention to user onboarding
3. **Testing Strategy**: Well-structured testing approach with unit, integration, and E2E tests

## Current Challenges & Blockers

### Analysis Challenges
1. **Scale**: Project has extensive codebase (200+ components) making comprehensive analysis time-consuming
2. **Configuration Complexity**: Understanding the full configuration system requires examining multiple files
3. **Theme Variations**: Each theme may have unique implementations requiring individual analysis

### Documentation Challenges
1. **Technical Depth**: Balancing technical accuracy with accessibility for different audiences
2. **Currency**: Ensuring documentation stays current as the project evolves
3. **Completeness**: Determining appropriate level of detail for each aspect

## Active Questions & Uncertainties

### Technical Questions
1. **Plugin System**: How do plugins interact with themes and core functionality?
2. **Build Performance**: How does build time scale with content volume and theme complexity?
3. **Error Handling**: What happens when Notion API is unavailable or rate limited?

### User Experience Questions
1. **Onboarding**: What's the actual user experience for setting up a new blog?
2. **Theme Selection**: How do users discover and choose appropriate themes?
3. **Content Management**: How intuitive is the Notion-based content management workflow?

### Maintenance Questions
1. **Update Cycles**: How frequently are dependencies updated and how are breaking changes handled?
2. **Theme Compatibility**: How are theme updates managed across the ecosystem?
3. **Plugin Lifecycle**: How are plugin updates and deprecations managed?
