# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Content creators, bloggers, and knowledge workers using Notion face significant challenges when trying to publish their content online:

1. **Technical Barriers**: Most Notion users aren't developers and struggle with:
   - Setting up web hosting and domains
   - Learning web development frameworks
   - Managing build processes and deployments
   - Handling SEO optimization and performance

2. **Platform Limitations**: Existing solutions have major drawbacks:
   - Notion's built-in sharing is limited and not customizable
   - Traditional blogging platforms require content migration
   - Static site generators require technical expertise
   - Most solutions lack the rich media support Notion provides

3. **Maintenance Burden**: Once a blog is set up, users need to:
   - Keep software dependencies updated
   - Manage hosting costs and configurations
   - Handle security updates and backups
   - Maintain consistent styling and functionality
